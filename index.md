## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Management Experience
**Chief Technology Officer** @ [TOOGONET](https://toogonet.com/) _(Jan 2014 - Aug 2021)_ <br>
Toogonet provides a SaaS platform Toogo and on demand services to Destination Management Companies. As the original project shifted to a much bigger one, I volunteered to the role of CTO as the company was growing and needed someone to be purely in charge of the IT team & processes.
  - Managed a team of up to 8 developpers
  - Embraced the dynamics previously set and then implemented new methods and tools at every stage of the project : administration, sales, conception, design, development, support. 
  - Created a new organizational structure based on delegating that improved the SaaS platform stability.
  - Planned and executed the launch of a variety of new products that enforced Toogo as a leader platform on the market for DMC companies ERPs and helped to preserve customer retention.
- As technology evolves, bringing new technology to the table was essential, so I encouraged my team to regularly reassess the tools used.
